// The Filter Picker: the wheel selections (PinballY's [Top] filters) and
// the filter groups leave the main menu for this submenu, which lists the
// selections the main menu module still shows (as Menu Cleanup and the
// filter conditions left them, PinballY's mark on the current one), the
// groups (the one holding the Active Filter marked), then Back. The main
// menu module creates it, hands it each main menu opening and the way to
// reopen the main menu on an entry. Its main menu entry names the Active
// Filter as the menus show it. It is shown by turning a main menu opening
// into it (ev.id and ev.items edited in "menuopen"), not with showMenu,
// which fires no "menuopen": so the Drawn Menus Add-on draws it like any
// other menu. Back and Exit go up one level at a time (see docs/adr/0013).
// Listens to "menuopen", "menuclose", "command", "attractmodestart" and
// the game list's "filterselect".
