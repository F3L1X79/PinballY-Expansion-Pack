// Household Stats module: the drawn screen the player opens from the
// Profile Stats' "Household Stats" button to set the Household's Profiles (every
// Profile but Guest) side by side: a centred Steamball panel over the
// dimmed wheel, laid out by the Household Stats painter, with one column
// per Profile (its Avatar in the Avatar Frame it wears; the active one
// first unless it is Guest, then the Profile picker's order) and one line
// per stat where more is better, the best of each line in gold. Every
// value is read again on each opening, through the Profile Stats' reader,
// one Profile per step of the shared screen opening (docs/adr/0014). While open
// it swallows every button through "commandbuttondown": Next / Prev move
// the Selection Marker (a gold glow flowing round the choice) through the
// Exit Button at the top right, then from column to
// column, looping, with PinballY's navigation sound. Past five columns
// (fewer in a narrow window), the columns glide sideways to keep the
// marker in view, the marker following its column on every frame, the ones cut by the view's edges
// faded, and coming from the Exit Button jumps instead of gliding across
// them all. The Button Hints' footer names the flippers, Select and Exit. Select or Launch on another Profile's column opens its Profile
// Stats read-only, whose Exit shows this screen again on that column; on
// one's own column or the Exit Button it goes back as Exit does. While
// that screen is open, this one waits set aside, hidden (as the Profile
// Stats do under their children, see common/stats/drawn_screen.js).
// Exit closes it and calls the return given to open(); attract mode only
// closes it. Opens directly, not through the
// wheel dialog module: the player asked for it. isOpen() and onClosed()
// let the wheel dialogs wait for it.
