// Challenge module: owns the Challenges' state model. The week's
// Challenge is drawn the first time it is needed in a week, among the
// feasible templates other than the previous Challenge's (tables of a
// manufacturer or decade, different tables, manufacturers or decades,
// never the community tables' manufacturer as an option; tables never
// played or not played for six months, reachable by every Profile that
// sets the bar; the Table of the Day on different days or days played, never
// more than the days left; games on the Table of the Week, on the same
// table or launched as Random Games; minutes on one table or in total).
// Its target is the same for every Profile, drawn in its template's own
// range and capped by what can be reached (visible tables, tables of the
// group, the least across the Profiles that set the bar, days left); a
// cap below the range's minimum makes that option infeasible. It is
// locked in cabinet.json with the previous one; each Profile, Guest
// included, follows it in its own profile.json ("challenge"), where the
// games that count are kept with their facts, progress being recomputed
// from them. The game that first reaches the target completes the
// Challenge: the Profile's completed count goes up and a Challenge Toast is
// submitted, celebrated with the Confetti Shower. When a Profile first
// shows up in a later week, the previous Challenge is judged
// once and the verdict kept in its history. It also selects the Challenge
// Tables among the tables the active Profile can see, for the templates
// where some tables move the Challenge forward, and reads a Profile's
// record of completed Challenges.
// Created from the PinballY host, the Profile store, the Period Tables, the
// Random Game module, the Achievement Toast module and a random source; the
// Add-ons share one instance through getChallenges(). Notes each game's facts
// on "gamestarted" and counts it when the Profile store announces its Play.
