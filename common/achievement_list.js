// ============================================================
// Achievement List module: the screen the player opens (from the main menu
// or the Profile Stats) to browse every Achievement of the active Profile
// in one drawn scrolling list over a dimmed wheel (see docs/adr/0005): a
// header with the Profile (its Avatar in its worn Avatar Frame, from the
// Profile Rewards module), its total and its count per Achievement Rank,
// then the Unlocked Achievements (a toast still waiting first, then the
// most recently Notified) and the missing ones (the highest Unlock Rate
// first, then the furthest Achievement Progress), each part under its
// section header. A missing Secret Achievement's row shows "???" and its
// hint instead of its title and description. Each row shows its rank
// emblem (the owner's image, without its halo since the colour and the
// rank edge already tell an Unlocked row; greyed when missing; drawn when
// its file is missing, logged once per file), when missing its
// Achievement Progress, and its Unlock Rate: the Avatars of the other Profiles Notified of it,
// once the household has two Profiles besides Guest.
// Next / Prev glide the highlighted line from one Achievement to the next,
// wrapping, with PinballY's navigation sound; the other lines are dimmed.
// Exit closes the list and calls the return given to open(); attract mode
// closes it too. While it is open, every button is swallowed through
// "commandbuttondown".
// Each item (a row or a section header) has its own layer, only moved and
// faded while the list is open; the header and footer sit on a mask layer
// above the rows, the header's small emblem images on layers above it. Each
// emblem image, Avatar and "+N" pill of the rows sits on a small layer of
// its own, one set per on-screen slot, moved with the rows. When the list
// overflows the rows area, a gold scrollbar sits in the panel's right
// margin: its rail on the mask, its thumb on a layer of its own, moved with
// the glide.
// Every layer is drawn ahead from startup through the shared drawing
// ahead, nearest the highlighted line first, kept from one opening to the
// next and redrawn only when what it shows or the window size changed.
// What the list shows is read again on each opening, and ahead after a
// Profile switch or a change of a Profile's data; the other Profiles'
// files only when their Notified Achievements may have changed.
// The Profile Rewards module gives the header's Avatar Frame (null: none).
// Opens directly, not through the wheel dialog module: the player asked
// for it.
