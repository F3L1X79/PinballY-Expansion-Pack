# PinballY Expansion Pack

*[🇫🇷 Version française](README.fr.md)*

An unofficial extension of [PinballY](http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinballY.php) that gives everyone in the house a Profile, weekly Challenges, Achievements and a real reason to come back to your pincab, without touching PinballY.

## Profiles

Each of you picks your own Profile and Avatar with Change Player, and the Welcome Screen greets you by name, so you know whose games will count. Only games of a minute or more count, and Guest is always there for visitors. **My Profile** sums up your pinball life; **Household Stats** sets everyone side by side, the best of each line in gold. An Admin Profile keeps the setup entries for you, and a Child Profile leaves the Adult Tables off the wheel.

→ [Profiles](docs/guide/en/profiles.md)

## Achievements and Challenges

A new Challenge every Monday, the same for the whole household, its card tracking your progress on the wheel screen. Dozens of Achievements from Bronze to Platinum, a few of them secret, each announced by a toast without interrupting your games. Every one of them raises your Player Level, shown on your Avatar.

## Choosing a table

The Welcome Screen offers the Table of the Day and the Table of the Week: play them several days or weeks in a row to build a Table of the Day or Table of the Week Streak. Every minute on a table builds your Mastery Level of it, from Rookie to Pinball Wizard. High Scores are credited to the Profile that played, whatever the initials, and shown on a podium. Short of ideas? A Random Game spins on a wheel of fortune.

## Interface

PinballY's menus and messages in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian or Portuguese, drawn in the pack's Steamball look and sorted into sections. A clock, a gold arc under the wheel, launches without a black flash, and sounds you can replace with your own. **Expansion Pack Settings**, in the Operator Menu, turns each Add-on on or off.

## Install

Requires **Windows** and **PinballY 1.1.0 Beta 10** or later (plus the *Windows Media Player* optional feature for the sounds, already there on Windows 10 and 11). No git needed.

1. **Download `ExpansionPack.zip`** from the latest release: https://github.com/F3L1X79/PinballY-Expansion-Pack/releases/latest (not "Source code (zip)", whose folder isn't found by the pack).
2. **Extract it into `PinballY\Scripts`**: you should get `PinballY\Scripts\ExpansionPack\main.js`, not `ExpansionPack\ExpansionPack\main.js`.
3. **Create `PinballY\Scripts\main.js` with only this line**, or **add this line to it** if it exists. Your own scripts keep running.
   ```js
   import("./ExpansionPack/main.js").catch(e => logfile.log("ExpansionPack: " + e.message));
   ```
4. **Optional: put `vpxtool.exe`** (https://github.com/francisdb/vpxtool/releases) **in `ExpansionPack\tools`**, so each table's ROM is filled in by itself. Without it, a "Problem" toast reminds you at each start; turning the Table ROMs Add-on off silences it.
5. **Restart PinballY.** `PinballY.log` shows one "initialized" line per Add-on; errors are also kept in `Scripts\ExpansionPack\errors.log`.
6. **Choose your Add-ons**, the startup screen and the language in **Expansion Pack Settings**, in the Operator Menu, then restart PinballY in one press.

Everything the pack keeps (settings and Profiles) stays in `Scripts\ExpansionPack`: copy it to back up, delete it and the import line to uninstall. PINemHi 3.6.8, `.env.local` and installing with git: see the [install page](docs/guide/en/install.md).
